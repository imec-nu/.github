*Embedding intelligence into the world around us*

</div>

## 🎯 About Us

At IMEC, we work at the intersection of **systems**, **embedded AI**, and **data** to develop resource-efficient and real-time systems that embed intelligent perception, reasoning, and understanding into everyday infrastructure and objects.

Our mission is to make computing **smarter**, **smaller**, and more **sustainable** — enabling services that improve quality of life while pushing the boundaries of what's possible at the edge.

## 🔬 Research Areas

Our work spans multiple domains:

- **Mobile & Embedded Systems** — Optimizing computation on resource-constrained devices
- **Edge Computing** — Processing data where it's generated
- **Signal Processing & Machine Learning** — Real-time intelligent analysis
- **Cyber-Physical Systems** — Bridging physical and digital worlds
- **Wearables & Health** — Technology for well-being
- **Robotics** — Autonomous systems with embedded intelligence
- **Intelligent Built Environments** — Smart buildings and infrastructure
